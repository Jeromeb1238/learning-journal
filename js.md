## Summary of Pages 43 - 69 of Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery

Html, css, and javascript all work together.  Html is the 'structure' document.  The css and js file are linked into the html file.  One can also include javascript within the html file but this is considered bad practice.

Javascript is a scripting language written in plain text.  The extension '.js' indicates javascript file.  Javascript runs where it is found in the html; so positioning of the script in html fule is important.

## Javascript bullets:
- Each line of code is a 'statement'
- A statement ends with semi-colon ';'
- Script that goes intween the curly brackets is called *Code Block*
- Comments go inbetween /*  comments go here */
- Variables are a means to temporarily store a value.  Variable needs to be *'declared'* and a variable needs to *'assign a value'*
    - syntax: var varName;  This example declares varName; note the statement ends with semi-colon
    - syntax: var varName = "John"; This example *declares* a variable called 'varName' and *assigns* a value of 'John'.
