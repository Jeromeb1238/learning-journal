Git vs GitHub

[Git Getting Started](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/)

**GitHub is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**

- Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.
- Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
- Committed Data is securely stored in a local database
Modified File has been changed but not committed to the database
Staged Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot


To check settings, use the git config --list command.

## Getting Git Help
- git help command
- git command --help
- man git-command

## Git Add - Commit - Push
- git add * = Track all files in respository
- git status = provides information of changes to be committed
- git commit -m "insert message here" = After staging one or multiple files, you should commit the changes and record what you did within the commit message
- git commit -a = commits a snapshot of all modifications to tracked files in the working directory
- git push origin master = *This command pushes changes from the local “master” branch to the remote repository named “origin”.

## Remote Repositories
- For cloned repositories, Git will automatically give the name “origin” to the server from which you cloned and the name “master” to your local branch.
- git remote -v = you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names
- git remote add shortname url = To create a new remote Git repository with a short name, use the following format:
- git fetch [remote-name] = Fetching entails pulling data that you don’t have from a remote project.
- git fetch origin = Use for Cloned Repositories  to pull down any new changes that were pushed to the server since you cloned or last fetched from it.  solely pulls new data to a local repository; it does not merge changes with or modify your local work
- git push [remote-name] [branch-name] = To push your changes “upstream” for sharing
- git remote rename = To rename a remote’s short name,
- git remote rm < filename>
