Git vs GitHub

[Git Getting Started](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/)

**GitHub is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.

Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

Committed
Data is securely stored in a local database

Modified
File has been changed but not committed to the database

Staged
Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
