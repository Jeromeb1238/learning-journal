 Names should be 8-20 characters, 10-16 ideal
 Never use i or j in for loop white board interview
 
 Make sure one calls functions and in what order 
 
 Scope (in code); block of code in which a name is valid:
 - global; available within entire file; minimize global variables
 - local; available within function, inbetween {} 
 
 Reviewing code: look for things that are the same over and over.  If arrays or variables will always change with new values, declare as 'empty' value
 Code: write to solve today's needs now; don't build functionality that will never be used
 
 Loops and more Loops
 ```java
 for(var i=0; i < 3; i++) {
  for(var j = 3; j > 0; j--) {
    console.log( i, j);
  };
}
```
