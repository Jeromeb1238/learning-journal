### Intro to Java
- To write a script need to
    1. Define goal
    1. List tasks needed to achieve goal
    1. Then code the tasks
- Flowcharts are a good means to outline a script; 4 different types of tasks and shape in flowchart:
    - Generic step: rectangle
    - Event: elongated hexagon
    - input/output: parallelgram
    - Decision: diamond

### Expressions
- Expressions evaluate to a single value
- There are two types of expressions
    - expressions that assign a single variable, ie. var color = 'beige';
    - expressions that use two or more values to return a single value

### Operators
    - Operators perform/specify an action to an Expression that evaluate to a single value
    - Types of operators
        - Assgnment operators
        - Comparison operators: i.e. >, <, =
        - Arithmetic operators:
        - Logical operators: true/false
        - String operators: " insert string text here "

### Functions
- Functions group together a series of statements to perform a specific task
- Functions store code required to perform a specific task, and that the script can ask the function to perform that task whenever needed.
- Syntax: function functionName ( parameters go here) { code block goes in here}
     - Note: no paramters need to be included when declaring function
- To call a function, type functionName followed by open/close paranthese's; ie. function functionName ();
